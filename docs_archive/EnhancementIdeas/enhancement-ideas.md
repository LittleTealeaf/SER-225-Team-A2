# Enhancement Ideas

Below is a list of potential enhancement ideas that could be made to this game.

## More levels

Right now this game only contains five levels. We think that having a game have up to 20+ levels would add lots of dimension to the game. Users enjoy working through challenging levels.

## Increased ways to kill enemies

We implemented a way to kill the enemies but many games feature the ability to kill AI by jumping on their head. We think this would be a great addition to our game.

## Lives/Health

Name a single platformer game where you get a game over after getting touched by an enemy one time...yeah none of them do this because it's not very fun. Most games have a concept of "lives" where you can try a level again before a game over occurs, and they are booted back to the main menu. Some games implore the idea of health, where the player can be hurt by enemies multiple times in a level before dying.

## More ways to die

Enemies work great to hinder the player's progression through a level, but most games have other means of doing so like falling in a bottomless pit, landing on spikes, etc. Would definitely spice things up a bit. We included dying by jumping into the water but using lava or other barriers would be interesting to see.

## Game music/sounds

We added sound to the game but having sound effects for jumping, walking, swimming, or dying would add a lot to this simple game.

## Slopes

Just putting this here to warn anyone that is interested in implementing slope map tile types into the game that it is HARD and I don't recommend doing it without a solid understanding of how the game's map tile system works. There are so many ways to implement them with their own different pros and cons, and even games known for their slopes like 2D Sonic the Hedgehog games have some bugs (you just don't notice them because in those games you move very fast).

## Adjusting aspect ratio

During Scrum Sprint 4, we struggled to complete the task of changing aspect ratio in the options screen. Many expert gamers love this ability and adding this to the game would be very time consuming. We thought this would be a great additon as well.
