# Team A2
For our project, one of the tasks that we were required to do was to create and run test cases for each of our bug fixes or enhancements. We first used a `.docx` format, as seen in the [User Stories](User%20Stories) folder.

However, in order to allow both the ease of viewing on any device, and a nice display on our github repository, we later switched to a `.md` format. We converted all previous test cases to the new format, and placed everything in [Test Cases](Test%20Cases)
